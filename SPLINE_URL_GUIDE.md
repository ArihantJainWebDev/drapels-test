# 🎯 How to Get the Correct Spline URL

## 🚨 **Current Status**
Your 3D avatar is temporarily showing a beautiful animated fallback to prevent the runtime error. Here's how to get your Molang avatar working:

## 📋 **Step-by-Step Guide**

### 1. **Open Your Spline Project**
- Go to [spline.design](https://spline.design)
- Open your Molang 3D project

### 2. **Export for Web**
- Click the **Export** button (top right)
- Select **Code** → **React**
- You'll get a URL that looks like:
  ```
  https://prod.spline.design/[PROJECT_ID]/scene.splinecode
  ```

### 3. **Alternative: Use the Share Link**
- Click **Share** button
- Copy the **Public Link**
- The URL should be in format:
  ```
  https://prod.spline.design/[PROJECT_ID]/scene.splinecode
  ```

### 4. **Update Your Code**
Once you have the correct URL, update these files:

**In `SplineAvatar.tsx`:**
```typescript
// Change this line (around line 53):
const [forceDisableSpline] = React.useState(true);
// To:
const [forceDisableSpline] = React.useState(false);

// And update the sceneUrl (around line 46):
sceneUrl = 'YOUR_CORRECT_SPLINE_URL_HERE'
```

**In `HeroSection.tsx`:**
```typescript
// Update the sceneUrl prop (around line 245):
sceneUrl="YOUR_CORRECT_SPLINE_URL_HERE"
```

## 🔧 **Common URL Formats That Work**

✅ **Correct formats:**
- `https://prod.spline.design/[ID]/scene.splinecode`
- `https://prod.spline.design/[ID].splinecode`

❌ **Incorrect formats:**
- `https://my.spline.design/[ID]/` (editor URL, not export URL)
- `https://spline.design/[ID]` (missing prod subdomain)

## 🎨 **What You'll See**

### **Right Now:**
- Beautiful animated Molang-themed placeholder
- Rotating elements and floating particles
- Professional fallback that matches your brand

### **After Fixing URL:**
- Your actual interactive 3D Molang character
- All the same animations and responsive design
- Users can interact with your 3D scene

## 🚀 **Testing Steps**

1. Get the correct URL from Spline
2. Update both files with the new URL
3. Change `forceDisableSpline` to `false`
4. Refresh your page
5. Check browser console for any errors

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

- **Test the URL first**: Paste it directly in browser to see if it loads
- **Check file size**: Large Spline files may load slowly
- **Optimize your scene**: Reduce polygons/textures for better performance
- **Keep the fallback**: It's great UX for slow connections

Your homepage looks amazing with the current fallback! The 3D avatar will make it even more impressive once we get the URL sorted. 🎉
